# Changelog

## 2024-07-15 (JK)
> Added uc6_csmTools as submodule by using 
`git submodule add -b "feature/package_management" https://github.com/fairagro/uc6_csmTools/`. The branch [`feature/package_management`](https://github.com/fairagro/uc6_csmTools/tree/feature/package_management) was created to ensure installability of the package.

> Reason: The module also contains the data from BonaRes, etc. which is needed for the pipeline.

> Consideration: Is root (`./`) the appropriate path for that?
